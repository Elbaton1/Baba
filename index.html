      <p>My love,</p>
      <p>
        You are the most wonderful, kind-hearted, and beautiful person I have
        ever met. Every moment with you feels like a dream, and I am endlessly
        grateful to have you in my life. Your smile brightens my days, and your
        love warms my heart. You are truly incredible, and I cherish every
        moment with you.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for being you. I love you more than words can express.</p>
      <p>Love, <strong>Your Michael</strong></p>
